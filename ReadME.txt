DISCORD DB

A python library which uses discord servers as a database
Very simple for now

Hierachy of the Discord DB

--> Controller (Discord BOT)
   --> Database (Discord Server)
      --> Cluster (Discord Category)
         --> Table (Discord Text Channel)
            --> Data

Subject to discord's ratelimits
A fun little project, dont use in prod (It would be extremely funni and based if you do tho)
